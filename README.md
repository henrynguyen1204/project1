# Project 1 - Voice-Controlled Motor System

This project implements a voice-controlled motor system using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. The system recognizes specific voice commands to control motor operations, making it suitable for applications like voice-activated robotics or appliances.

## Features

- **Voice Command Recognition**: Utilizes a neural network model to interpret audio inputs and recognize predefined commands.
- **Motor Control**: Interfaces with motor hardware to perform actions based on recognized voice commands.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes audio inputs and controls motors in real-time, ensuring responsive operation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: 
  - Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32)
  - Motor driver
  - Microphone module
- **Software**:
  - [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/) development framework
  - [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henrynguyen1204/project1.git
   cd project1

2. **Set Up ESP-IDF**:
   Follow the [ESP-IDF setup instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) to configure your development environment.

3. **Configure the Project**:
   Use `menuconfig` to set up project-specific configurations:
   ```bash
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```

4. **Build and Flash**:
   Compile the project and upload it to your microcontroller:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   idf.py flash
   ```

## Usage

Once the system is set up and running:

- **Voice Commands**: Speak predefined commands into the microphone. The system will process the audio input and control the motor accordingly.
- **Customization**: Modify the `main_functions.cc` file to add or change voice commands and corresponding motor actions.
